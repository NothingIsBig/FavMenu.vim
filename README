Adds a new menu to vim
You can add your favourite files (and dirs) into it, and open them later by clicking on the corresponding menu item.
The file list is persistent, data is stored in a file, which is the value of the $FAVOURITES
This variable should hold the name of your favourites files with full path.
So it must look like "~/.vim_favourites" or 'c:\program files\vim\_favourites'.
